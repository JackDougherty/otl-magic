Original caption: Click a colored rectangle to view racial restrictions, typically against residents “other than the Caucasian race,” that some housing developers wrote into property deeds in the Hartford region. In 1921, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the right of private property owners to insert these restrictions, but later ruled in the 1948 Shelley v Kraemer case that they were no longer enforceable by governmental authority. Yet restrictive language still exists in the legal property records today. To date, we have found racial covenants for a handful of housing developments in West Hartford. Have you seen or heard about other restrictions, in other towns?

## HOLC Redlining Map, 1937

Original caption: Click colored regions to view pages from the Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) appraisal report, which this federal agency created with local lenders to evaluate the "trend of desirability" in residential areas in Hartford and over 200 other cities during the late 1930s. The HOLC color-coded map portrayed the highest grade (A) in green and the lowest grade (D) in red. This government agency considered not only housing conditions but also the "social status of the population," and downgraded neighborhoods with non-white, immigrant, and poor residents. In later decades, these actions became associated with the discriminatory practice of "redlining." See also the two original maps (Hartford-West Hartford and East Hartford), the full appraisal report, and a searchable spreadsheet.

Original caption: Search any Connecticut address to compare aerial imagery from two time periods, side by side. Our default map displays 1934 versus the current satellite view (with additional layers from the 1950s, 1970s, and 1990s to come). For example, view the influence of post-war interstate highway development on urban neighborhoods (such as the I-84 exchange in Hartford’s Parkville neighborhood)(http://magic.lib.uconn.edu/otl/dualcontrol_aerialchange.html?lat=41.76&long=-72.701&layerA=1934&zoom=15), or suburban commercial and residential development on formerly rural farmland (such as WestFarms Mall in Farmington/West Hartford)(http://magic.lib.uconn.edu/otl/dualcontrol_aerialchange.html?lat=41.723321&long=-72.762176&layerA=1934&zoom=15).

## Zoning Maps of West Hartford, 1924-present

Original caption: In 1924, during its early phase of mass suburbanization, West Hartford became the first Connecticut municipality to enact zoning regulations to manage residential, commercial, and industrial land use. This dual-view interactive tool allows users to compare maps from consultant Robert Whitten’s West Hartford Zoning report (1924) to the present. The original report stated that West Hartford’s primary function was to serve the housing needs of “all classes and all grades of economic ability. . .[including] factory workers, office employees, and the various business and professional groups” who work in Hartford. But it also separated town residents by wealth and excluded others who could not afford to live there. Zoning policies created residential districts with minimum lot sizes to promote more expensive single-family homes, thus making multi-family housing “uneconomic” to build, without expressly prohibiting it.

## TO DO
- continue to resize all maps to be max 700px (based on 10px padding in PBT style) OR resize as 100% with proportions
- for both timesliders, replace depreciated YUI slider (http://yui.github.io/yui2/docs/yui_2.9.0_full/slider/index.html) with jQuery slider (https://jqueryui.com/slider/#steps)
- for zoning map, try to insert additional georeference TIF layers (1930, 1951, etc.) in drop-down menu
